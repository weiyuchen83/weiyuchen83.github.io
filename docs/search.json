    "text": "For our final year project, we planned, filmed, and recreated key moments from Breaking Bad as a way to study and reproduce the show’s visual style and storytelling techniques. We began by selecting scenes that highlighted the series’ signature tone, then broke them down shot-by-shot to understand camera angles, blocking, pacing, lighting, sound, and color. Using that analysis, we created storyboards, shot lists, and a production schedule, and assigned roles across directing, cinematography, acting, sound, and editing.\n\n\n\nDuring production, we focused on matching the original look and feel through careful location choices, props, costume design, and controlled lighting setups. In post-production, we edited our footage to mirror the rhythm of the source material and used color grading and sound design to recreate the tense, cinematic atmosphere. The final outcome is a short recreation that demonstrates our ability to translate professional screen language into our own production workflow, while reflecting on how composition, performance, and editing shape mood and character."

    "text": "Story behind my FYP Project + why this visualization style\n\n\n\nI created this chart during my student project when I was exploring how a TV series builds momentum and audience over time. I chose a bar chart because the data is discrete and episodic (each episode is a separate item), and bars make it easy to compare exact values between episodes without implying smooth continuity like a line might. I also grouped and colored the bars by season because seasons are meaningful “chapters” in a TV show—this design helps viewers see both the within-season variation and the between-season trend at a glance.\n\n\n\nThe main rationale was storytelling: I wanted the visualization to immediately answer the question, “Did the show get more popular over time, and when did it spike?” The bar chart format makes that growth unmistakable, especially in Season 5B, while the seasonal colors provide structure and reduce confusion when many episodes are shown together."

    "text": "How GenAI has helped me in this individual task:\n\n\n\nChatGPT supported me mainly in the early drafting stage. It helped me brainstorm and refine the wording for my website text so it sounded clearer and more professional. It also assisted by suggesting Quarto/R Markdown code for adding and formatting images (such as file paths, captions, and sizing). Aside from those parts, I completed the rest of the work independently, including writing the final content, organising the pages, creating the website structure, and rendering/publishing the site."
