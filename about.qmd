title: "FYP Project"

For our final year project, we planned, filmed, and recreated key moments from Breaking Bad as a way to study and reproduce the show’s visual style and storytelling techniques. We began by selecting scenes that highlighted the series’ signature tone, then broke them down shot-by-shot to understand camera angles, blocking, pacing, lighting, sound, and color. Using that analysis, we created storyboards, shot lists, and a production schedule, and assigned roles across directing, cinematography, acting, sound, and editing.

During production, we focused on matching the original look and feel through careful location choices, props, costume design, and controlled lighting setups. In post-production, we edited our footage to mirror the rhythm of the source material and used color grading and sound design to recreate the tense, cinematic atmosphere. The final outcome is a short recreation that demonstrates our ability to translate professional screen language into our own production workflow, while reflecting on how composition, performance, and editing shape mood and character.
